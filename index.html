	<p>I think for me the meaning of Christian is “Christ like”. I believe that Jesus Christ never judged, he just
	accepted all. I think that’s the way we should be, accepting of people and not judging . You’ve just got to
	make the best of life and just be happy where you are.</p>

	<p>My faith always keeps me going. It always keeps me happy and grateful. I don’t think I would be the person
	I am today without it. We are told to be like light unto the earth. People recognise that there’s something
	different about me, I get a lot of remarks at work about it.</p>

	<p>I think it’s always been there for me. I went through the toughest year of my life last year and it didn’t
	sway my faith, it reassured my faith. Because I’d seen what kind of person Lizzie was and how she lived, it’s
	nothing that I could turn my back on, I’ve always been a believer that it wasn’t God taking her away from
	us, I’m not a person that believes that’s God’s punishment or that’s God’s plan. I didn’t struggle with my
	faith, but did I think was it God’s plan that Lizzie would die when she was 21? The conclusion that I came
	to is that God’s will and that God’s plan are two different, separate things. I’m not a person who can believe
	that God wanted Lizzie to die at 21, it just doesn’t make any sense to me. I wouldn’t believe that.</p>

	<p>A few years ago I felt nervous about telling people that I was Christian. But now I’ve kind of come into my
	own - I’m not scared to say this is me, this who I am, and it’s what I believe. I’m more open about it now
	and I’m not afraid to tell people my views, or stand up for Christianity.</p>

	<p>I’m 21 now and it’s not as hard to not give into social pressure. There are things I think I trip myself up on,
	but it’s about what I think is right for me and I think there are people who think that it is weird or ques-
	tion that. But I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ve just got to own it and at the end of the day, that’s just
	me and I’m not going to change, I just need to find people who accept that.</p>

	<p>It’s not hard to stay true to yourself, but it’s hard to believe that people will be accepting of all the ways you
	would want to stay true to yourself. You don’t think people will accept it.</p>

	<p>To me being a christian means living the best life in all the best possible ways, whether that is devoting
	your life to helping others or just being the best version of you there is.</p>
	<p>There have been many times when We felt nervous telling people about my faith. This is not because l’m
	ashamed of it; sometimes people don't necessarily understand faith and religion and can judge and mock
	you for it — but my faith has had a positive impact on my life. If it weren't for my faith I would never have
	met three of the most amazing people in my life.</p>
	<p>I think that the truth behind stereotypes depends on the religion in question. Some Christian—based reli-
	gions are completely different to what non—religious people would assume they are, and they would be sur-
	prised by how 'normal' some religious people are.</p>
	<p>l only find being a Christian daunting when lam around certain types of people. Sometimes people can
	come to their own conclusions of what you are like and you can feel afraid of correcting them, telling them
	that no, you're not actually like that and telling them you believe in morals and having self respect. In this
	day and age, believing in God is not considered to be ‘cool’.</p>

	<p>I find that religious stereotyping is not as stark as it used to be; there are probably more stereotypes about
	what goes on in the Christian church rather than the people who go there. I imagine a lot of people think of
	church pews, set prayers, mass, hymns and a long sermon, but the Christian church is very diverse and
	every denomination is different.</p>
	<p>I'm not at all nervous or ashamed of saying lam a Christian - my belief is part of who lam. l've never felt
	the need to declare openly to any new people in my life that l am a Christian. l don't keep my friends sepa-
	rate based on their beliefs and l've never felt judged by anyone for believing in something they don't.</p>
	<p>There will always be times in life when you doubt yourself and your beliefs - it's human nature to question
	things — but faith is what helps me and l have never doubted that God exists. There is just something in me
	that tells me he is real in whatever form.</p>
	<p>Faith has had a positive impact in my life. l know people who aren't related to myself but whom l consider
	family members because of church. Faith has certainly helped me in difficult circumstances and situations;
	it means I have someone - God — to lean on and draw strength from when l need it.</p>
	<p>Being a Christian does mean being ‘Christ like‘; we can draw on qualities of Jesus that are portrayed in the
	bible and try and emulate them in our own lives. This does not mean we are going to get everything right
	and we are all perfect. There are thousands of people who aren't Christians who don't judge, who love others,
	who work continually to help people less fortunate than themselves. For me being a Christian is much
	more a personal commitment. I believe in God, Jesus, the Holy Spirit. 1 don't go round declaring it because I
	don't think I need to. My one peeve is the many Christians who misquote or use certain bible verses to pass
	judgement on others because of their beliefs, sexuality, life choices etc. We can't judge people via standards
	and structures that were set up thousands of years ago because the world is a much changed place. While l
	can learn and draw strength from the bible, I can't judge people via its teachings, because that would go
	against who Jesus was. I can apply certain things to my own life, but I can't force anyone to do the same. For
	me being a Christian is walking your own personal path of faith, not denying who you are and what you
	believe, to yourself or to others.</p>
	<p>Being a Christian is different for every person and every person sets their own personal standard on what
	they will do or take part in. Some churches have certain standards but I think being a Christian means find-
	ing your own path also. For instance l would never get involved or allow myself to be pressured into taking
	part with witchcraft, seances or Ouija boards, because as a Christian, I believe in both God and the devil, so
	knowingly putting yourself into a situation where you are toying with the ‘supernatural’ is, for me, a dan-
	gerous thing. This is why I don't watch horror movies, especially those that involve supernatural content.
	There are some Christians who are perfectly fine watching a gore fest or something involving exorcism, l
	just don't think the subject is one to be toyed with. This is something I have always stood my ground on
	and l will state to people whether they judge me on it or not.</p>
